Web Page Design Implementation Introduction This task is part of a project/assignment for "The Odin Project" course. It involves creating a web page based on a provided design. Participants will receive two images: one displaying the complete website design and another detailing fonts and colors. The objective is to replicate the design as closely as possible, inserting actual content and images as necessary. Happy coding!

The images used in the project were obtained from www.pixabay.com, kudos for the good quality of the images!
