                <p>And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey was at its end.
                    You start with something pure. Something exciting. Then come the mistakes,
                    the compromises. We create our own demons. As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.
                    Took a little tinkering. But then I thought "why stop there?" Of course there are
                    people who say progress is dangerous, but then I bet none of those idiots ever had
                    to live with a chest full of shrapnel. And now, neither will I.
                    Let me tell you: that was the best sleep I'd had in years. So if I were to wrap
                    this up tight with a bow or whatever, I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a
                    distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon.
                    And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys.
                    One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man.</p>
